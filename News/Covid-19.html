<h1><u>The Covid-19</u></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Due to the fact that the corona virus is spreading all over the world in alarming rate, Our School has decided not to give the lesson in the same trend as before rather we have agreed to give the lesson online for the benefit of both of us.<br>

Therefore we have started the online teaching program on Telegram and the links for the groups created for this purpose will be send on the parent's. And this is the message from the Executive Directress Abnet Woldekidan 

<br>
Dear Parents,<br>
Welcome to School of Tomorrow’s Educational telegram program.<br>
We hope you and your family are doing well.  School of Tomorrow recognizes that our students are missing their education.  As part of the endeavor to prevent this and to enable our students to use their time productively and keep the continuity of the lesson we have provided this platform.   
We will be posting worksheets, Home works, notes, and other teaching and supplementary materials on this platform so that our students can be engaged at home during the prolonged break.  
Since our students have been away for quite some time, we will start with a revision of the 3rd Quarter lessons.  Review Questions from all the subjects will be provided and students should copy the instructions in the worksheets only (not the Questions) in their C.W exercise books and give answers.  The answer keys will be posted the next day so that students can do the corrections accordingly, in separate new lines next to the answers.  The exercise books will be checked for completion and marked as school reopens, by their respective teachers.  
Lessons will proceed to be provided, once revision is complete.<br>         
We kindly request parents to follow up and try to provide a quiet place with a table and a chair for the children to be focused and effectively complete their lessons/work on a daily basis.  
For easy reference, we will keep below a suggested schedule for our children’s daily routine. 
<br>
Thank you for your cooperation, stay safe and healthy!
<br>
Abnet Woldekidan
